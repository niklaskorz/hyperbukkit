HyperBukkit
===========

HTTP for Bukkit


Installation
------------
1. `cd` into your `plugin` directory
2. clone the repository and name it `hyperbukkit.py.dir`
3. install the [Python-Plugin-Loader](https://github.com/masteroftime/Python-Plugin-Loader)
4. make sure to use a `jython.jar` with version 2.7 (there's one under Downloads here, just download it and put it in your `lib` directory of your craftbukkit folder)

Don't forget to edit the `config.yml` in `plugins/HyperBukkit/`, which gets created after the plugin's first run.
